  Dear reader,
   
  <p></p>
Drip Drop cultivators, Arran French and Josh Levanos discovered their passion for fashion in the summer of 2016. In a basement where old sewing machines were kept, Arran found himself intrigued. Deciding to ask his mom for instruction, She gladly obliged. Arran was eager to share his newly learned skill with his best friend, Josh and, just like that, Trippy Trousers were born. Less than one month sewing and the two had set up a full-fledged workshop in that same basement.
 
<p></p>
Now, here's where we come in. I'm Drip and that's Drop. We're the fashion designers that used to be Arran and Josh, but so drippy, you wouldn't recognize any similarities. To the exhilarating bang of trap music, we have since fashioned a multitude of extraordinary fabrics, bringing to life a kaleidoscopic array of patterns and styles. We seek to add a splash of color to the monotony of everyday streetwear. We create our clothing with booming hues and psychedelic patterns that radiate happiness and confidence.
  
  <p></p>
  Think of us as the Birds of Paradise in the Fashion Jungle.
